# NodeMCU Delivery System
We created a delivery system which could be controlled by the internet. It consisted of a robotic arm and a car. We programmed the NODEMCU and made connections such that the car as well as the robotic arm could be easily controlled by the Blynk platform from anywhere in the world. This could be the stepping stone to creating a completely autonomous last mile delivery system. Also we used OpenCV and Image processing to integrate with our dynamic inventory and tracking system.
NodeMCU based IoT end to end delivery system that can be easily controlled from any part of the world with Blynk application.
